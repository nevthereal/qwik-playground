import Todo from "~/components/Todo";

# You can use MDX files as routes!

This is actually amazing. Just create an `index.mdx` file in your routes like that:

```
routes
├── index.tsx
├── layout.tsx
├── docs
│   └── index.mdx # like this!
```

But here it is also possible to import Components!

<Todo completed="true" content="This is a tsx component!" />
